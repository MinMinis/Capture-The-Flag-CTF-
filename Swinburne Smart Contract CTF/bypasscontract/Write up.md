The `VaultManager` smart contract is designed to restrict access to non-contract addresses. If the address belongs to a contract indicated by a non-zero code size, access is denied.

# Vulnerability

The vulnerability lies in the method used to determine whether the caller is a contract. The `extcodesize` assembly opcode is used in `validateUser` to check the code size of the caller‚Äôs address. It can be bypassed by contract that invoke the function during their construction phase. This is because `extcodesize` returns `0` for contracts during their construction phase, as the code is not yet stored on-chain. This is one of the [OWASP Smart Contract Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-smart-contract-top-10/2023/en/src/SC04-access-control-vulnerabilities.html) which belong to access control vulnerabilities. 

# Exploit development

To exploit the vulnerability, I can spoof an address using `vm.prank` (line 16) in the test environment provided by Foundry. the test simulates an externally owned account sends transaction, and bypass the `validateUser` function and gain access.

Test the exploit for `VaultManager` contract

# Explanation of Exploit

In the `testVaultAccess` function, the `vm.prank` utility used to simulate a transaction originating from an address. It is used with an address not associated with a deployed contract, the `extcodesize` check in `validateUser` returns `0` , as the address does not contain any code. This will bypass the restriction in the `authenticationAccess` function and set the `accessGranted` to `true`

The exploit work perfectly

So the address I use to bypass in this case is `0x1234567`

Formatted flag: `CTF{0x1234567}`

# Mitigation

The vulnerability is in the `validateUser` function, specifically the check on `extcodesize(account)` (line 8) to determine if the sender is a contract or an externally owned account. The only change is changing the comparison from `> 0` to `== 0`

Mitigation for `VaultManager` contract

This will ensure only external owned accounts to access the vault and not contracts. This is more secure because when the `codeFootprint` is exactly `0` , meaning that the address has no code. If the contracts have code, or the address is a contract, `extcodesize` will return a value grater than 0 which means the contracts will be rejected. 

Test again but fail to exploit:
